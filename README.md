## Title
#### AI Cooking manager - Ghost CookKing

## Proposal

#### AI cooking assistant - Ghost CookKing - is a dish recipe recommendation system and will let us know the cooking steps. So to speak, we are trying to make a service that acts like a kitchen assistant.
#### A User of LG signature appliance can use an application called 'Signature Kitchen Suite'. One of this application's function is that a user can see what's in his refrigerator. We can import the list of ingredients from refrigerator.
#### We will use Kaggle's recipe dataset or a recipebox dataset that nicely scraped from websites.
#### Using the recipe dataset, ingredients and classification system, Ghost CookKing will make a suggestion based on existing ingredients and user's command, and let us know what to buy more to cook that dish.
#### Moreover, when you start cooking, you will be informed of the cooking process step by step. If possible, it will be improved by automatic adjustment of of fire or oven.
