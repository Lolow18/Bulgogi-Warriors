## Title
AI Cooking manager - Ghost CookKing

## Proposal

 AI cooking assistant - Ghost CookKing - is a dish recipe recommendation system and will let us know the cooking steps. So to speak, we are trying to make a service that acts like a kitchen assistant.
A User of LG signature appliance can use an application called 'Signature Kitchen Suite'. One of this application's function is that a user can see what's in his refrigerator. We can import the list of ingredients from refrigerator.
 We will use Kaggle's recipe dataset or a recipebox dataset that nicely scraped from websites.
 Using the recipe dataset, ingredients and classification system, Ghost CookKing will make a suggestion based on existing ingredients and user's command, and let us know what to buy more to cook that dish.
 Moreover, when you start cooking, you will be informed of the cooking process step by step. If possible, it will be improved by automatic adjustment of of fire or oven.
